-- it optimizing the query.
-- one index have two more more columns and it is faster to the read the data.

use sql_store;

create index idx_state_points on customers(state,points); -- here we have two column but index name is same.
explain select  customer_id from customers 
where state = 'CA' and points > 1000;


Drop the index like this:


use sql_store;
drop index idx_points on customers;



use sql_store;
create index idx_lastname_state on customers(last_name,state); -- mentionning column wise it read the data 
explain select customer_id from customers where state = 'CA' and last_name='A%';

create index idx_state_lastName on customers(state,lastName);
explain select customer_id from customers where state = 'Ny' and last_name='A%';

-- here first go to the state selecting matching state and then chceck the matching index have the starting name with A are not.

-- based on the column wise we can used and also cardinality importent means unique values in the columns.
