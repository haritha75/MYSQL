By default the order is ascending

USE sql_store;

SELECT *
FROM customers
ORDER BY first_name;

query:
Get customers first name in descending order


USE sql_store;


SELECT *
FROM customers
ORDER BY first_name DESC;

HW:


USE sql_store;

SELECT *
FROM order_items
WHERE order_id = 2
ORDER BY (quantity*unit_price);

USE sql_store;

SELECT *, unit_price * quantity AS total_price -- here changing column name
FROM order_items
WHERE order_id = 2
ORDER BY total_price DESC;
