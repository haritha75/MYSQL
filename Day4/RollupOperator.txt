select 
   payment_method,
   sum(amount) as total
from payments 
group by payment_method with rollup; -- and also we canot use elise name whenever using rollup operator


query:

use sql_invoicing;

select 
   payment_method, --if you write like pm.name as payment_method
   sum(amount) as total
from payments p
join payment_methods pm
on p.payment_method = pm.payment_method_id
group by payment_method with rollup; -- here showing error because we are using alias name so  using direct name pm.name.
